# 📊 Quantitative Finance Projects

> *Exploring the intersection of Mathematics, Finance, and Code.*

This repository documents my journey into quantitative analysis. I've built these projects to move beyond textbook theory and understand the **mathematical intuition** behind financial models.

## 📂 Project Collection

| Project | Core Concept | Key Insight |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **1. [Efficient Frontier](./efficient_frontier)** | Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) | Visualizing how diversification mathematically reduces risk without sacrificing returns. |
| **2. [Price Derivative Analyzer](./price_derivative)** | Calculus (Derivatives) | Using 2nd derivatives (acceleration) as a leading indicator for price reversals. |
| **3. [Monte Carlo Simulator](./monte_carlo_sim)** | Stochastic Calculus & VaR | Simulating 1,000+ futures to quantify "Value at Risk" (VaR) and probability distributions. |

## 🧠 Deep Dives

### 1. Efficient Frontier Visualizer
*   **The Goal:** Prove that "don't put all your eggs in one basket" is a mathematical fact, not just advice.
*   **The Math:** Simulated 5,000 portfolios using random weights to plot Risk (Volatility) vs. Reward (Return).
*   **Result:** Identified the "Efficient Frontier"—the optimal set of portfolios offering the highest return for a defined level of risk.

### 2. Price Derivative Analyzer
*   **The Goal:** Apply Calculus I concepts to trading signals.
*   **The Math:** Calculated the 1st derivative (Velocity) and 2nd derivative (Acceleration) of price moving averages.
*   **Result:** Discovered that "Acceleration" often crosses zero *before* the price peaks, acting as a powerful early warning signal.

### 3. Monte Carlo Risk Simulator
*   **The Goal:** Quantify the uncertainty of future stock prices.
*   **The Math:** Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) with Drift and Shock components.
*   **Result:** Generated a probability distribution of future prices to calculate VaR (Value at Risk) with 95% confidence.
